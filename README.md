SQL DB Class 1 Tavern Assignment<br>
Create Script for database where a system can keep track of taverns.<br>
• Taverns need a name, floor count, owner (user) info, and location info.<br>
• Have users of the system and their roles kept track of, with description of roles.<br>
• Have supplies kept track of with supplies, units, cost; plus the taverns' inventory with tavern id, supply id, cost, quantity, and date received.<br>
• Have the name of services offered as well as the status of the service (for example "active" or "inactive", and can add or change status later).<br>
Should be seeded with around 5 to 10 rows of data each, and add repeated fields for normalization.<br>
