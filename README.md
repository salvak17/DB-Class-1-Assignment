SQL DB Class 1 Tavern Assignment 
Create Script for database where a system can keep track of taverns.
• Taverns need a name, floor count, owner (user) info, and location info.
• Have users of the system and their roles kept track of, with description of roles.
• Have supplies kept track of with supplies, units, cost; plus the taverns' inventory with tavern id, supply id, cost, quantity, and date received.
• Have the name of services offered as well as the status of the service (for example "active" or "inactive", and can add or change status later).
Should be seeded with around 5 to 10 rows of data each, and add repeated fields for normalization.
